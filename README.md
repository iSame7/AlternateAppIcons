# AlternateAppIcons
iOS 10.3 Alternate Icon

AlternateAppIcons is an exmple app to show how iOS Alternate Icons work. [This feature](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplication/2806818-setalternateiconname) was introduced in iOS 10.3 beta1. This is a slightly strange feature, but the new beta allows apps to include icons and change between them with a call to this API.
You can see it in action:
